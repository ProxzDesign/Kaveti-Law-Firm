                                    Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are transformative strategies designed to consolidate or combine businesses to meet strategic goals. In an acquisition, one company takes over another, fully integrating its operations and assets. Conversely, a merger unites two firms to establish a new, singular corporate entity. Both approaches require meticulous valuation to determine fair pricing for the companies or assets involved. Financing these transactions typically involves a blend of debt, cash, and stock.
